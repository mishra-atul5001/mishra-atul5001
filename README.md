Welcome to a growing repository profile. I am by profession a Data Scientist working at an MNC 🏢.
- I love to write short programs and just do random ML problems. 😋
- Doing ML Problems these days is easy right!? Once you figure out to implement **Sklearn**, everything seems easy, but how do you present the results to the business. Well, that's where i really feel edged above.
- 🌱 I’m addicted to learning and growing every day.
- Looking for people to collaborate on DS/ML Hackathons or maybe solve any real world problem.
- Part-time engaged with ML Freelancing and DS Mentoring.
- FIFA Lover!! **World Class** is my Level!😉
